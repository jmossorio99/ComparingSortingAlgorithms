# ComparingSortingAlgorithms
This project's aim is to compare two sorting algorithms: Heapsort and TreeSort. In the experiment we will be comparing the algorithms by running them on machines with different proccesors (i5 7400, i7 6700HQ, i5 7200U), changing the programming language (will use Java, C# and Python), and changing the input size (10^3, 10^4, 10^5).

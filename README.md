# ComparingSortingAlgorithms
This project's aim is to compare two sorting algorithms: Heapsort and Timsort. In the experiment we will be comparing the algorithms by running them in different OS's (Windows 10 64 bits, Linux Ubuntu 18.04 64 bits), on machines with different proccesors (i5 7400, i7 6700HQ, i5 7200U), changing the programming language (will use Java, C# and Python), and changing the input size (10^2, 10^3, 10^4).
